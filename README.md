# Ecommerce App layout Design

This is my practicing small project for designing ecommerce app layout. It doesn't include any server side technologies. But I'll try creating full stack app soon.

## What I Learned

- [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/en/) - Routing and navigation for your React Native apps

## Built With

- [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) - a JavaScript framework for writing real, natively rendering mobile applications for iOS and Android
- [Expo](https://expo.io/)[Tools] - It allows you to start a project without installing or configuring any tools to build native code - no Xcode or Android Studio installation required

## Run it locally

1. Follow the [React Native Guide](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) for getting started building a project with native code.

2. Clone this repo

```
npm install

npm start
```

3. Install the [Expo](https://expo.io) client app on your iOS or Android phone and connect to the same wireless network as your computer. On Android, use the Expo app to scan the QR code from your terminal to open your project. On iOS, follow on-screen instructions to get a link.
